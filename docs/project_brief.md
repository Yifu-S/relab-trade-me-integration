**Property-Insights Pipeline MVP**

**Phase II - Additional Project Brief**

**Context**

- 2 main residential property investment strategies:
  - 1 - people looking for properties with development potential (large and flat land, close to nearby underground services - wastewater and storm water pipes etc.)
  - 2 - people looking for properties with good rental yield (Start from >6% p.a.)
- Their workflow is as follows:
  - Search on Trademe and filter by certain parameters that suits their investment strategy
  - Carry out detailed due diligence for upside & downside about:
    - Land
    - House
    - Nearby community
    - etc.

**The problem property investors face:**

- Trademe is the most popular sales listings platform, however its search/filtering capability is limited. Also Trademe is an advertising platform, therefore it does not offer the full set of information for detailed due diligence.
- Relab is a SaaS platform that offers detailed due diligence. However it doesn’t offer full set of sales listings features.
- Therefore many property investors:
  - Manually check information in both, before they make further property enquiries
  - Offen keeps a Excel to record a large list of property shortlist for further review. This process is very inefficient

**Ideal workflow:**

1. User Quickly scan latest Trademe listings, and filter through to a shortlist that they are interested in
2. Check this shortlist properties in Relab, for quick DD and refine the list further
   1. Enter an address in Relab
   2. Grab 4 x screenshots
   3. Combine Trademe listing information & Relab information into one dashboard against this property
   4. Move on to the next property
   5. …
3. Carry out further DD on the refined list

**Possible ways to solve it:**

- By code (**Yifu to explore**)
- By using existing tools (I.e. existing agentic workflows - **ChatGPT Agent mode**)
- By a combination of the two (i.e. Automation + LLM - **n8n**)
- Others?
