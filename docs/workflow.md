**Workflow**

This solution enhances the user's existing browsing behavior on Trade Me with automated Relab integration, minimizing disruption.

1. **Setup & Installation:**

The user installs the custom Chrome browser extension.

The extension connects to a backend service (e.g., an n8n workflow or a simple server) that can access the Relab platform.

2. **Browsing & Discovery (User-Driven):**

The user browses Trade Me listings as they normally would, using Trade Me's search and filters. When they find a listing they are interested in, they land on the property's detail page.

3. **Initiating Due Diligence (User Action):**

The browser extension detects that the user is on a Trade Me listing page. It then displays Relab screen next to the Trademe listing page (split screen), so the user can view all the information from â„¢ and Relab together, to do their DD review.

It displays a new button on the page, for example, labeled "Get Relab Data" or "Analyze in Relab". The user clicks this button.
